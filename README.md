## SYNOPSIS

Yet Another Scheme Interpreter, Revised.

This time it's based on the CEK machine rather than the SECD machine used by
the previous one ([YASI](https://github.com/overminder/YASI)).

The implementation is mostly from [Pycket's
paper](http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/samth/pycket-draft.pdf).
